# ad-and-leine

This is my project file for the very millenial-y and couple-y blog that Adhithya Mohanraj and I always meant to get around to. While on one hand, this feels very unatural and uncomfortable, I'm doing it on GitHub because my understanding how to do this at all is apparently very attractive.

So yeah.
