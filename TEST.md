# First Post

My girlfriend Madeleine and I have been talking about starting a blog for a while, and in the spirit of New Year’s, we finally decided to get started.

Since this is the first post, I’ll start by introducing myself. My name is Adhithya Mohanraj, but my friends mostly call me AD. I’m a second year college student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. In my free time, I love playing soccer, working on personal projects, and exploring the Bay. I’ve also been trying to pick up the guitar, although I haven’t yet progressed beyond playing simple chords.

In this blog, I’d like to talk about my experiences with Leine exploring, adventuring, and going on dates in the Bay Area. I’m also hoping to use this blog to document my progress in various goals that I have for the year, as well as writing about my journey to discover the best food in the Bay. I also want to develop my writing skills, and keep a record of some of the most memorable events and activities that Leine and I do together!

Sprinkled throughout I’ll also probably write about some of my personal computer science projects. In particular, I’ve been thinking of writing some posts on random neural networks that I’ve been building in TensorFlow, along with my experiences with Project Euler. If you don’t know what any of those things are, stay tuned!

Overall, I hope that this blog will be a random mish-mash of the things I do, personal goals I have, things Leine and I do together, and our relationship goals.
